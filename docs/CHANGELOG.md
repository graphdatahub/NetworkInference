TODO:

- Make the manifold visual work for any *intrinsic* dim 2
- Check why the signal generation seems to provide the same trajectories across nodes
- Debug MLEs
- Try [EPyT](https://epanet-python-toolkit-epyt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html) to compare with infrastructure systems
- Try DTW and GW
